# üõ°Ô∏è SOC-Kali-Logs

Access and monitor **Kali Linux logs** remotely using **PuTTY**

---

## üìò Project Overview

This lab demonstrates how to access and view **system logs from a Kali Linux machine** remotely using **PuTTY** on Windows.
It‚Äôs a simple yet effective setup for understanding remote connections and log monitoring ‚Äî an essential skill for anyone learning **SOC (Security Operations Center)** practices.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Steps to Set Up

### **Step 1: Get the Kali Linux IP Address**

1. Open the **terminal** in Kali Linux.
2. Run the command `ifconfig`.
3. Note down the **IP address** of your Kali system.

### **Step 2: Open PuTTY on Windows**

1. Launch **PuTTY** on your Windows system.
2. In the **Host Name (or IP address)** field, enter the IP address you noted from Kali.
3. Click **Open** to start the SSH session.
